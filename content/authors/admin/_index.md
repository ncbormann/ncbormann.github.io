I am a political scientist at the [University of Exeter](http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/politics/) and I am affiliated with the [Identity & Conflict Lab](https://web.sas.upenn.edu/pic-lab/) at the University of Pennsylvania.

In my [research](http://socialsciences.exeter.ac.uk/politics/staff/bormann) I investigate why political elites in ethnically divided societies decide to cooperate rather than fight one another, how economic inequality between ethnic groups develops over time, and what effects international intervention has on the stability of ethnic power sharing. 

In September 2019, I will join the [Department of Government](https://www.essex.ac.uk/departments/government) at the University of Essex.
