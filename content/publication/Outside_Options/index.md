abstract: How does external intervention affect the viability of negotiated power-sharing settlements to internal armed conflicts? We argue that external support for rebel actors in secessionist conflicts undermines the effectiveness of territorial power-sharing settlements. The main mechanism that increases the risk of conflict recurrence is rebel confidence in the ability to extract more concessions due to the outside option offered by a foreign patron. We test our claims using a mixed method research design. We analyze quantitative data from a sample of ethno-territorial armed conflicts where autonomy concessions were used to reduce the risk of conflict recurrence, testing for differences in the outcomes of conflicts with and without prior intervention. We then provide process-tracing evidence from four cases of armed conflicts that reveal how foreign intervention contributed to the failure of autonomy settlements. We conclude that the impact of territorial power-sharing is likely to be conditional on patterns of external intervention â€“ a finding with significant implications for the management of ongoing internationalized ethno-territorial wars.
